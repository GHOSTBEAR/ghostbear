<h1 align="center">Hallå där 👋</h1>

Here is a ghostbear which is known as Andreas and he lives in a great country which lies in Scandinavia called Sweden. He likes working on mobile applications, but as long as code is involved he will probably work on it without much complaining. When he is not coding then he is probably cooking something or enjoying some manga.

🌱 Ghostbear is currently learning more about Android Development with Kotlin

⚡ Fun fact he will most likley do a table flip if he sees old code
